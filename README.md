# Introduction

***

In this repo, I will write about the problems students face on campus network and attempt to provide solution (feasible or non feasible). The solutions end at Section 3.

In Section 4, I will write in depth discussion on why does few protocols, which are really good, like Wireguard, UDP based VPNs, etc. do not work on campus network. Feel free to skip that section if you are not interested.

Section 5 deals with Contributing rules and Section 6 ends with a vote of thanks to people who helped me in anyway.
