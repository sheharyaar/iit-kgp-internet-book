# Further Steps

***

This repository is available for anyone who wishes to add upon this work or needs information for any purpose or maybe be implement own VPN. For me, I would love to research more on this topic and look for ways to improve the Internet situation at the campus. It was really difficult with bad network at the campus to be able to even talk with parents on video call as whatsapp and similar apps are blocked.

Believing in open source I hope someone will add value to this repository, so that even people with less technical experience can understand basic comparisons among the various servers and technologies.
