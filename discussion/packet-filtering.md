# Packet Filtering

| Protocol | Status | Proof | Remarks |
| ---  | --- | --- | --- |
| UDP  | :warning: | <ul><li>The network connected well to server hosted on Cloud on non standard port `55555` over UDP. But the connection is dropped after just a few requests (<a href="https://github.com/sheharyaar/iit-kgp-network/issues/2">see issue</a>)</li></ul>  | <ul><li> UDP works and connects to an external server on any unused port, other than the standard ports.</li><li> As common ports are most probably blocked, services like `DNS` doesn't work. Hence programs depending on DNS-name resolution like `dig` and `nslookup` won't work. The server is able to use **only the DNS provided by campus network DHCP** </li><li>To make DNS work we need `iptables` magic on Linux. This `iptables` is used by expressvpn to forward DNS requests. Read More in Discussions.</li></ul> |        
| TCP  | :warning: | <ul><li>Server hosted on cloud could be connected via `netcat` and `telnet` without issues on port `55555` and similar private ports.But the connection is dropped after just a few requests (<a href="https://github.com/sheharyaar/iit-kgp-network/issues/2">see issue</a>)</li></ul>|<ul><li>TCP Based VPNs do work even though very much slow</li><li>Servers outside the campus network can be accessed over TCP comfortably, on any unused port other than the common ports.</li><li>`tor` cannot be used (TCP over LTS) as it cannot connect to the nodes.</li><li> Need to check tor on a private port and update info.</ul>|
| ICMP |:heavy_multiplication_x:| <ul><li>`ping` and `traceroute` doesn't work at all</li></ul> | <ul><li>ICMP packets are plainly dropped displaying normal firewall behaviour.</li></ul> |
